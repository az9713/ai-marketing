# Tribe Builder

Use this skill to create copy that builds cult-like following for your product. Based on Blair Warren's "One Sentence Persuasion Course."

## The Framework

> "People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help throw rocks at their enemies."

This is the most powerful framework for building a devoted user base. It goes beyond features to create emotional connection.

## The 5 Elements

### 1. Encourage Their Dreams

**What it means**: Validate their aspirations. Tell them their goals are achievable.

**For AI products**:
- "You CAN build production AI apps without a PhD"
- "You CAN compete with big tech as an indie developer"
- "You CAN automate your entire workflow"

**Template**: "You can [dream they have] even if [obstacle they fear]"

### 2. Justify Their Failures

**What it means**: It's not their fault. The tools/system failed them, not the other way around.

**For AI products**:
- "It's not your fault the old tools were too complex"
- "You weren't slow - your tools were holding you back"
- "The system was designed to keep you dependent on consultants"

**Template**: "It's not your fault that [failure]. [External cause] made it impossible."

### 3. Allay Their Fears

**What it means**: Remove risk and uncertainty. Make them feel safe.

**For AI products**:
- "You won't break production - sandbox mode protects you"
- "You won't lose your data - we never train on your code"
- "You won't get locked in - export anytime, open format"

**Template**: "You won't [fear] because [protection mechanism]"

### 4. Confirm Their Suspicions

**What it means**: Validate what they've always suspected but couldn't prove.

**For AI products**:
- "You were right - the old system WAS rigged against indie devs"
- "You were right - enterprise tools ARE overpriced for what they do"
- "You were right - most AI hype IS just marketing"

**Template**: "You were right about [suspicion]. Here's proof: [evidence]"

### 5. Throw Rocks at Their Enemies

**What it means**: Define a common enemy and attack it together.

**Common enemies for AI products**:
- "Legacy gatekeepers" - big companies that hoard access
- "Bloated enterprise software" - complex, overpriced tools
- "The old way" - manual, tedious processes
- "Consultants who overcomplicate things"
- "Vendors who lock you in"

**Template**: "[Enemy] has [bad behavior]. We exist to [opposite]."

## Usage Process

### Step 1: Identify Your Audience
Who are they? What do they want to become?

### Step 2: Map Their Psychology
- Dreams: What do they aspire to?
- Failures: What have they tried that didn't work?
- Fears: What stops them from acting?
- Suspicions: What do they secretly believe?
- Enemies: Who/what do they blame?

### Step 3: Generate Copy for Each Element
Create specific copy hitting each of the 5 elements.

### Step 4: Combine into Full Message
Weave elements together for maximum impact.

## Examples

### Example: AI Coding Tool

**Audience**: Indie developers frustrated with complexity

**1. Encourage Dreams**
> "You CAN ship production-quality AI features without a team of ML engineers."

**2. Justify Failures**
> "It's not your fault previous AI tools required PhDs to use. They were designed for research labs, not real products."

**3. Allay Fears**
> "You won't break anything. Every change runs in a sandbox first. Your production code stays safe."

**4. Confirm Suspicions**
> "You were right - those enterprise AI platforms ARE overpriced and overcomplicated on purpose. They want you dependent on their consultants."

**5. Throw Rocks**
> "We're done with the gatekeepers who made AI feel impossible. This is AI for builders, not for boardrooms."

**Combined**
> "The AI gatekeepers want you to believe you need a team of PhDs to ship AI features. You don't. Their tools are complex on purpose - to keep you paying for consultants. We built something different: AI that just works, in a sandbox that keeps your production safe. This is for indie devs who are tired of being locked out. Join us."

### Example: Project Management Tool

**Audience**: Startup founders tired of enterprise tools

**1. Encourage Dreams**
> "You CAN run a world-class team without bloated enterprise software."

**2. Justify Failures**
> "Your team isn't disorganized. Your tools are. You've been using software designed for 10,000-person companies."

**3. Allay Fears**
> "You won't lose your data. You won't get locked in. Export everything, anytime, in open formats."

**4. Confirm Suspicions**
> "You were right - you've been paying enterprise prices for features you'll never use."

**5. Throw Rocks**
> "Jira was built for bureaucrats. We built this for builders."

**Combined**
> "You've been told you need enterprise software to run a real team. That's a lie sold by vendors who profit from complexity. You don't need 500 features. You need 10 that actually work. Join the founders who left the bloated tools behind."

## Enemy Selection Guide

| Product Type | Effective Enemies |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Dev tools | Enterprise vendors, gatekeepers, complexity merchants |
| Productivity | Meeting culture, busywork, "the way it's always been done" |
| AI products | Hype merchants, closed-source lock-in, credentialism |
| B2B SaaS | Legacy incumbents, overpriced alternatives, consultants |
| Consumer | Big tech surveillance, algorithms that manipulate |

## Warning: Use Ethically

This framework is powerful. Use it only for products that genuinely help people. Don't:
- Create fake enemies
- Exploit real fears unethically
- Make promises you can't keep
- Divide communities harmfully
