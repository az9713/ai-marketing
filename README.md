# AI Marketer

**Your Product Hunt launch is about to flop. Here's why.**

That headline you spent an hour on? It scores 15/40 on psychological effectiveness. Generic. Forgettable. Skipped.

This Claude Code plugin scores your copy against the same 4 triggers behind $100M campaigns — and rewrites it in seconds.

## 30-Second Demo

```bash
$ score "An AI-powered tool that helps developers code faster"

## NESB Score: 14/40 ❌ (Weak)

| Dim  | Score | Issue                    |
|------|-------|--------------------------|
| NEW  | 3/10  | Generic "AI-powered"     |
| EASY | 4/10  | No ease claim            |
| SAFE | 3/10  | Zero social proof        |
| BIG  | 4/10  | Vague "faster"           |

### Try Instead:
"Stop mass-deleting AI slop. Ship production code in one prompt."
Score: 34/40 ✅
```

One command. Instant diagnosis. Copy you can steal.

## What NESB Means

Every headline that converts hits 4 brain triggers:

| Trigger | Your Brain Wants | High-Score Example |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **N**ew | Novelty | "The first..." / "Unlike..." |
| **E**asy | Low effort | "One click" / "Zero config" |
| **S**afe | Trust | "Trusted by 10,000..." |
| **B**ig | Transformation | "10x faster" / "Dominate" |

Miss one? Your copy gets ignored.

cd ai-marketing
claude
```

No API keys. No config. No marketing degree.

## Before / After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "An AI-powered development tool that helps developers write better code faster." | "Stop mass-deleting AI slop. Join 10,000 engineers who ship production code in one prompt." |
| **14/40** — Generic, no proof, vague | **35/40** — Loss aversion, social proof, specific outcome |

---

## Who This Is For

**Indie hackers and founders** who:
- Launch products that get ignored despite being technically superior
- Write "AI-powered solution for..." copy (we've all done it)
- Know their product is good but can't articulate *why* it matters

**It's not your fault.** Dev tools teach you to build, not to sell. This fixes that.

---

## What's Included

- **5 Commands** — Score, audit, generate, analyze, extract
- **3 Agents** — Research, content generation, review
- **8 Skills** — Deep framework implementations
- **Optional Hooks** — Configure auto-reminders in `.claude/settings.local.json`

## The Psychology

> "People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help them throw rocks at their enemies."
> — Blair Warren

This plugin doesn't generate copy. It engineers persuasion.

## License

MIT — Use it, fork it, ship it.

**Stop blending in.**

*Your next launch deserves better copy.*
