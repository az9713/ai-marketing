## Understanding the Basics

### What is AI Marketer?

AI Marketer is a Claude Code plugin that helps you write marketing copy that converts. It's based on 5 bestselling marketing psychology books and makes their proven frameworks accessible through simple commands.

### Why You Need This

Most technical people write copy like this:
> "AI-powered development tool with advanced machine learning capabilities."

This is **weak copy**. It:
- Sounds like everyone else
- Focuses on features, not benefits
- Has no social proof
- Doesn't trigger emotional response

AI Marketer helps you write copy like this:
> "Stop losing hours to debugging. Join 10,000 senior engineers who ship 3x faster with context-aware AI. Unlike generic autocomplete, we read your entire codebase."

This is **strong copy**. It:
- Leads with pain (loss aversion)
- Includes social proof (10,000 engineers)
- Promises specific outcome (3x faster)
- Differentiates from alternatives

### How It Works

AI Marketer applies 5 proven marketing frameworks to your content:

1. **NESB Scoring** - Ensures your copy is NEW, EASY, SAFE, and BIG
2. **Awareness Analysis** - Matches your message to your audience
3. **Persuasion Audit** - Checks for 7 psychological triggers
4. **Tactical Optimization** - Applies specific persuasion techniques
5. **Tribe Building** - Creates movement-inspiring copy

## The 5 Marketing Frameworks

### Framework 1: Problem Awareness (Schwartz)

**The Problem**: Most founders pitch features to people who don't even know they have a problem.

**The Solution**: Match your message to where your audience is:

```
AWARENESS SPECTRUM
==================

Unaware ─────────────────────────────────► Most Aware

"I don't even    "I have this    "Solutions    "I know your    "Ready
 know I have      problem but     exist but     product but     to buy"
 a problem"       don't know      which one?"   not convinced"
                  solutions"
```

**How to Use This**:

| If Your Audience Is... | Lead With... | Example |
|------------------------|--------------|---------|
| Unaware | The symptom | "Spending 40% of your time debugging?" |
| Problem Aware | The outcome | "Ship code 3x faster" |
| Solution Aware | Your mechanism | "The only AI that reads your full codebase" |
| Product Aware | Proof and offers | "10,000 developers trust us. Try free." |
| Most Aware | Price and urgency | "50% off this week only" |

**Common Mistake**: Jumping to "Solution Aware" copy ("We use RAG and vector embeddings!") when your audience is still "Problem Aware" (they just want to ship faster).

---

### Framework 2: Seven Persuasion Levers (Cialdini)

Every piece of marketing should trigger at least 3-4 of these:

#### 1. Authority
Make people trust you through credentials.

**Examples**:
- "Built by ex-Google engineers"
- "Featured in TechCrunch"
- "Used by Fortune 500 companies"

#### 2. Social Proof
Show that others are using it.

**Examples**:
- "Join 50,000 developers"
- "★★★★★ rated on Product Hunt"
- "10M+ downloads"

#### 3. Commitment & Consistency
Get small yeses before the big ask.

**Examples**:
- "Star us on GitHub" → "Try the free tier" → "Upgrade to Pro"
- Free trial before paid plan
- Progressive onboarding

#### 4. Liking
Make your brand relatable.

**Examples**:
- "Built for developers, by developers"
- Friendly, casual tone
- Shared frustrations ("We were tired of...")

#### 5. Reciprocity
Give before you ask.

**Examples**:
- Free tools or calculators
- Open source core
- Educational content

#### 6. Scarcity
Make it feel limited or urgent.

**Examples**:
- "Early access for first 100 users"
- "Founding member pricing ends Friday"
- "Private beta - apply for access"

#### 7. Unity
Create tribal belonging.

**Examples**:
- "Join the movement"
- "Built for indie hackers"
- Shared enemy ("tired of bloated enterprise tools?")

**Scoring Your Copy**: Rate each lever 0-10. Aim for at least 35/70 total.

### Framework 3: Tactical Persuasion (Cialdini et al.)

These are specific techniques to improve any copy:

#### Loss Aversion
People work 2x harder to avoid losses than to gain rewards.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Increase productivity 50%" | "Stop losing 4 hours every day" |
| "Gain new customers" | "Stop losing customers to competitors" |
| "Get better results" | "Stop leaving money on the table" |

#### Specific Social Proof
Vague numbers are weak. Specific is powerful.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Thousands of users" | "12,847 active users this week" |
| "Many companies trust us" | "Used by Stripe, Shopify, and GitLab" |
| "Developers love us" | "★★★★★ from 500+ reviews on G2" |

#### Negative Framing
What NOT to do is often more memorable than what to do.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Write better code" | "Stop writing buggy code" |
| "Save time" | "Stop wasting time on manual testing" |
| "Improve your marketing" | "Stop sounding like every other AI tool" |

#### Similarity Shortcuts
People trust those similar to themselves.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "For businesses" | "For indie hackers and solo founders" |
| "Enterprise solution" | "Built by a 2-person team who gets it" |
| "Professional tool" | "Made for devs who love the command line" |

### Framework 4: NESB - The 4 Emotional Triggers (Milligan)

Every headline should hit these 4 quadrants:

```
         NEW                    EASY
    ┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
    │                  │                  │
    │  "The first..."  │  "One-click..."  │
    │  "Revolutionary" │  "Zero config"   │
    │  "Unlike..."     │  "5 min setup"   │
    │                  │                  │
    ├──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
    │                  │                  │
    │  "Trusted by..." │  "10x faster"    │
    │  "Guaranteed"    │  "Dominate"      │
    │  "Proven"        │  "Transform"     │
    │                  │                  │
    └──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
         SAFE                   BIG
```

#### NEW - The Brain Craves Novelty
- "The first AI that..."
- "Revolutionary approach to..."
- "Unlike anything you've tried"
- "Introducing..."

#### EASY - The Brain Conserves Energy
- "One-click deployment"
- "Zero configuration required"
- "Get started in 5 minutes"
- "No PhD required"

#### SAFE - The Brain Fears Risk
- "Trusted by 50,000 developers"
- "SOC 2 compliant"
- "Money-back guarantee"
- "Used by Fortune 500"

#### BIG - The Brain Wants Status and Transformation
- "10x your productivity"
- "Dominate your market"
- "Enterprise-grade"
- "The only tool you'll need"

**Scoring**: Rate each dimension 0-10. Aim for 28/40 or higher.

### Framework 5: Tribe Building (Warren)

Create a movement, not just a product. Use these 5 elements:

#### 1. Encourage Their Dreams
Tell them they CAN do it.

> "You can build production AI apps without a PhD."

#### 2. Justify Their Failures
It's not their fault.

> "The old tools were designed by academics, not practitioners. That's why you struggled."

#### 3. Allay Their Fears
Remove the scary parts.

> "You won't break production. Our sandbox mode protects you."

#### 4. Confirm Their Suspicions
They were right all along.

> "You always knew the enterprise tools were overpriced and bloated."

#### 5. Throw Rocks at Enemies
Unite against a common enemy.

> "We're here to dethrone the overpriced gatekeepers who've held back innovation for too long."

**Key Insight**: Don't just sell a tool. Sell an identity. Your users should feel like part of a tribe fighting against a common enemy.

## All Commands Explained

### Two Invocation Methods (Same Results)

| Method | Example | How It Works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Natural Language** | `score "headline"` | Claude uses CLAUDE.md instructions |
| **Slash Command** | `/ai-marketer:score "headline"` | Claude loads `commands/score.md` |

**Both produce identical results** because CLAUDE.md (which contains the full framework) is always loaded when Claude enters the project directory.

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Frameworks

The magic happens when you combine frameworks:

```
"Stop losing 4 hours every day to debugging."
  └── Loss Aversion (Tactical)
  └── BIG (NESB)
  └── Justify Failures (Tribe)

"Join 10,000 senior engineers who ship 3x faster."
  └── Social Proof (Persuasion)
  └── SAFE (NESB)
  └── Specific Social Proof (Tactical)
  └── Unity (Tribe)

"The first AI that reads your entire codebase."
  └── NEW (NESB)
  └── Authority (Persuasion)
  └── Mechanism (Awareness)
```

### A/B Testing Headlines

Use `score` to compare variations:

1. Write 5 headline options
2. Score each one
3. Pick the top 2 scorers
4. A/B test in production
5. Learn what works for YOUR audience

### Voice Consistency

Before any content generation:

1. Run `voice` on your best existing content
2. Save the voice profile
3. Reference it in generation requests
4. Check output against profile

### Progressive Disclosure

For complex products:

1. **First touch**: Problem + Promise (Unaware/Problem Aware copy)
2. **Second touch**: Mechanism + Proof (Solution Aware copy)
3. **Third touch**: Offer + Urgency (Product/Most Aware copy)

## Common Patterns

### The Before/After

```
Before (Generic):
"AI-powered development tool"

After (Framework-Optimized):
"The first AI that reads your entire codebase -
ship 10x faster with zero setup.
Trusted by 50,000 developers."
```

### The Problem-Agitation-Solution

```
Problem: "Debugging takes 40% of development time."
Agitation: "That's 2 full days every week lost to
chasing bugs instead of building features."
Solution: "Stop losing time. Our AI reads your
entire codebase and catches bugs before you do."
```

### The Tribe Call

```
"We built [Product] because we were tired of
[common enemy].

Most [tools] are designed for [wrong audience].
That's why they fail [your audience].

[Product] is different. It's built by [identity]
for [identity].

Join [number] developers who refuse to settle
for bloated enterprise tools."
```

## Next Steps

1. **Practice**: Score 5 of your existing headlines
2. **Audit**: Run a full audit on your main project
3. **Generate**: Create a new README using the frameworks
4. **Iterate**: Keep improving until you hit 70+/100

Remember: Great marketing copy isn't about manipulation. It's about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates emotionally.
