## What This Is

Most AI product copy sounds the same: *"AI-powered solution for..."* — generic, forgettable, ignored.

This Claude Code plugin brings 5 battle-tested marketing frameworks into your workflow, so your GitHub READMEs, landing pages, and social posts actually convert.

## The 5 Frameworks

| Framework | Source | What It Does |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Problem Awareness Spectrum** | *Breakthrough Advertising* (Schwartz) | Match copy to audience awareness level |
| **7 Persuasion Levers** | *Influence* (Cialdini) | Engineer psychological triggers |
| **50 Tactical Techniques** | *Yes! 50 Ways* (Cialdini et al.) | Apply evidence-based persuasion |
| **NESB Scoring** | *Take Their Money* (Milligan) | Hit NEW, EASY, SAFE, BIG in every headline |
| **Tribe Building** | *One Sentence Persuasion* (Warren) | Create movements, not just products |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/az9713/ai-marketing.git

# Navigate to the project
cd ai-marketing

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Try it out (natural language)
score "Your headline here"
```

## Using the Commands

You can use commands in two ways:

### Option 1: Natural Language (Recommended)

Just type what you want:

```
score "Your headline here"
audit this readme
generate a readme for my project
analyze competitor https://example.com
extract my writing voice from this text
```

### Option 2: Slash Commands

If you register the plugin with `claude --plugin-dir "./.claude/plugins/ai-marketer"`:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/ai-marketer:score` | Score a headline against NESB (0-40) |
| `/ai-marketer:audit` | Full marketing audit of any URL |
| `/ai-marketer:readme` | Generate an optimized README |
| `/ai-marketer:compete` | Analyze competitor positioning |
| `/ai-marketer:voice` | Extract your writing voice |
