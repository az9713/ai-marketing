The more you know about your product,
0:02
the worse you become at explaining it.
0:04
It's called the curse of knowledge, and
0:06
it's the reason that a lot of people try
0:08
to market and sell great products that
0:10
end up becoming duds because it makes
0:13
you forget what beginners don't know.
0:16
Meaning, your expertise is actually
0:19
blocking your ability to sell. So, what
0:21
we're doing today is going through a
0:23
series of books that will help you
0:25
overcome that curse and position your
0:28
products so that you can actually sell
0:30
them. And one of these books has a
0:32
single sentence framework inside it that
0:34
I think is the simplest approach to
0:36
marketing that anyone can take. But I
0:38
must give a disclaimer on this video. Q
0:43
Spider-Man meme.
0:44
Remember, with great power comes great
0:48
responsibility. The fundamental
0:50
assumption in what I'm about to share
0:52
with you is that you are using it
0:54
ethically and that you have something
0:56
genuinely valuable to share with other
0:58
people. So please keep that in mind as
1:01
we go through some of these topics. Now
1:04
first let's knock out some of the
1:05
fundamentals with the godfather of
1:08
modern marketing. So first up on the
1:11
list is a book called Breakthrough
1:14
Advertising by Eugene Schwarz. So, it's
1:16
a very easy read, but the principles
1:18
inside of it are timeless. Now, I've
1:21
done an entire video on this, which I
1:23
will link if you want to see it. So, I'm
1:25
not going to go into extreme depth on
1:27
each of these. We're going to talk about
1:29
what it is and why it's important. So,
1:31
on the one level, we have problem
1:33
awareness levels. And what this means is
1:35
that any given person that you would
1:38
want to sell your thing to has a
1:40
different level of awareness about the
1:43
problem you solve. And so this awareness
1:45
can be represented on a spectrum from
1:47
completely unaware, they don't even
1:49
really recognize that they have the
1:51
problem all the way down to they're
1:54
super aware. So they know not only about
1:57
the problem, they know all the different
1:58
types of solutions, the different
2:00
products within those categories of
2:02
solutions, and they know of you, they
2:05
know about the offers, they know about
2:06
everything. So, an example of this might
2:08
be if you're into AI coding, for
2:11
example, or AI automation, you're
2:13
probably super aware of all of the
2:16
different models and what their offers
2:18
are. You know that you can go use Claude
2:21
Max or Cloud Ultra and get tons of API
2:23
credits for the best coding model there
2:25
is. And you know what that trade-off is
2:27
between all the different models, so
2:28
you're in that most aware stage. Or
2:32
maybe you're not, and what I said was
2:34
just gibberish, and you are up here
2:35
somewhere. Point being, people relative
2:38
to the problem they have that you solve,
2:40
they are on a spectrum. And this is why
2:43
it's important to do research about who
2:45
it is that you are selling to. And so
2:47
the second piece of this is market
2:49
sophistication stages. So what this is
2:51
basically saying is how exposed are they
2:55
to all of the different claims from all
2:58
of the different companies. So again,
3:00
this moves through stages. And what
3:03
these stages are are being able to just
3:06
make a direct claim all the way down to
3:09
having to introduce unique mechanisms,
3:11
escalating those mechanisms, and then
3:14
lastly ending with identification,
3:16
meaning eventually the market just
3:19
becomes about the identity of the person
3:22
you're selling to and not what your
3:24
product actually does. So, if you were
3:26
to think of the world of AI just for a
3:28
second, when it first started out and
3:31
you had large language models, all they
3:33
had to do was say, "Hey, you can chat
3:35
with an AI, right? Full stop, end of
3:38
sentence. That's all they had to say."
3:40
And people flocked to a tool like chat
3:42
GPT. But where we're at now, we're
3:45
really in stage four where they're
3:47
having to escalate new mechanisms all
3:49
the time. I think Anthropic probably
3:52
does this best. Think of all of the
3:54
developments around the skills
3:55
ecosystem, claude code, sub aents, their
3:59
agent SDKs. They're just all over it
4:01
with mechanism after mechanism. And then
4:03
eventually what happens is that it
4:05
becomes about the identity of the
4:07
person. And we're already starting to
4:09
see this with language model providers
4:11
where you have people that are diehard
4:13
anthropic fans and they won't even
4:15
really consider releases from other
4:17
companies. And then you have the same
4:19
thing with people that are fanboys of
4:21
chat chipt or gemini or grock or
4:24
whatever tool it might be. And so the
4:26
key principle here is that we need to
4:28
solve for both at the same time. We need
4:30
to talk to the prospect in a way that
4:32
respects how aware they are of the
4:35
problem in the first place. And then we
4:37
need to consider, well, what claims have
4:38
they heard? So what we're going to do is
4:40
we're going to go take a look real quick
4:41
at some companies that are actually on
4:44
Product Hunt right now. We're just going
4:46
to open up some of these and see what it
4:47
is. So, I'm going to open up pick key, a
4:51
secure password manager. So, this would
4:52
be a good one to look at because there's
4:54
a lot of password managers out there.
4:56
So, market sophistication, fairly
4:59
sophisticated. And then my level of
5:01
awareness about this is I've used
5:04
multiple password managers before and so
5:07
I know a good amount about what the
5:09
pricing should be, what type of features
5:11
they have compared to each other. I'm
5:12
like I'm probably at that level four of
5:15
problem awareness about this thing. And
5:17
so if we were to just scroll scroll
5:18
through and look at some other ones.
5:21
Post syncer. I think this one was
5:22
getting a lot of traffic lately. So why
5:24
not give Tibo a little love on the
5:27
channel. So we're going to open up both
5:28
of these and look at them real quick. So
5:31
we have visual password manager. This
5:34
doesn't really tell me anything. So far
5:35
it is a visual password manager. Am I
5:39
tired of remembering passwords?
5:42
No, I'm not. Why? Because I already use
5:45
a password manager. So, if this was
5:47
trying to target somebody that is lower
5:50
down in that awareness stage and they're
5:52
actually like aware of different things.
5:55
This doesn't do anything for me. I'm not
5:57
tired of remembering passwords because I
5:59
only have one password that I actually
6:00
need to remember which is my master
6:02
password. Okay, they have some unique
6:04
mechanism at least which is you can log
6:06
in with a photograph but that's not
6:08
really clear to me. Okay, so on the
6:10
market sophistication and problem
6:12
awareness spectrum, I don't think
6:15
they're doing a great job, at least if
6:17
they were trying to market to someone
6:18
like me. On the flip side, if we were to
6:22
go look at Tibo's launch for Postyncer,
6:26
create once, share everywhere. Post
6:29
syncer helps you manage all your social
6:31
accounts, schedule content, and create
6:33
AI video and images in minutes. So, if
6:36
we were to think about this for a second
6:38
as a creator, so I'm probably in the
6:40
ideal demographic for this, creating one
6:43
core idea on one platform like YouTube
6:45
where I do a lot of my long form stuff.
6:47
It's actually surprisingly difficult to
6:49
package that in a format that works for
6:52
all of these different platforms. And
6:54
so, this concept of create it once and
6:56
share it everywhere is a really good
6:58
headline for that level of problem
7:01
awareness. I'm deeply aware of how
7:03
annoying this problem is, but I honestly
7:06
haven't gone out and looked at a bunch
7:08
of tools like this. I tend to build
7:09
solutions myself and so this is speaking
7:11
to me at the proper awareness stage.
7:13
Now, as I scroll through this page, very
7:17
nicely designed. The only thing that
7:19
seems slightly missing is this seems
7:22
very undifferentiated to me from other
7:25
social media scheduling tools. Like I I
7:28
don't know why this would be better than
7:29
a tool like Buffer or Hootswuite or any
7:32
of these other tools outside of maybe it
7:34
has some of these other AI features in
7:36
it, but again I think those are things
7:38
that I would personally heighten. So we
7:40
can actually see down here that they do
7:41
have comparisons against all of these
7:43
tools which would work for an SEO
7:45
perspective. But for me as someone
7:47
that's in this problem phase, I'm
7:50
already curious because I've used some
7:52
of these tools before. I've used Hype
7:54
Fury. I've used Tweet Hunter. view
7:56
social pilot. Why is this different? I
7:59
would like to see that type of
8:00
information hoisted. So, I'll say it
8:02
right now. If you want to actually win
8:04
with whatever it is you're building,
8:06
whether it's an AI business, an
8:07
automation agency, you're building
8:09
software, whatever it is, ecom business,
8:11
doesn't matter. You need to have these
8:14
things nailed or else you're going to
8:15
waste time and money. You're going to
8:16
have low engagement on everything you
8:17
do, and you're going to have really poor
8:19
conversion rates on your landing pages.
8:21
So, if you don't want to fizzle out on
8:23
the launchpad, read that book. So, next
8:26
up is probably the most documented and
8:29
wellrespected book on persuasion. Now,
8:32
it is a heavier read than the others on
8:35
this list, but that's because there's a
8:37
lot of evidencebacked studies and
8:38
citations inside of it. So assuming
8:41
we're talking to the right person at the
8:42
right stage of problem awareness and
8:45
sophistication based on the other book,
8:47
how do we tap into fundamental
8:50
decision-making biases that every person
8:53
has? Because while we all want to
8:55
pretend that we live in the driver's
8:57
seat of our lives, we make most
9:00
decisions based on emotions and
9:03
subconscious biases and we justify those
9:07
decisions rationally after the fact. So
9:09
every successful SAS funnel, weight
9:12
list, onboarding flow, pricing page, app
9:15
UX fundamentals, whatever it is, they
9:18
follow the seven principles from this
9:20
book. And the best part of it is that
9:22
it's actually all backed by a ton of
9:23
evidence, not some random marketing guru
9:25
nonsense. So let's get in and actually
9:27
talk about each of these really quickly.
9:31
So what are the seven principles he lays
9:33
out in his book that drive human action
9:37
the most? So the first up on the list is
9:39
authority. People buy from people that
9:42
they think are experts on the subject.
9:46
The second one is social proof. People
9:50
buy when they have confidence that other
9:52
people have already made that decision.
9:55
Third, commitment and consistency.
9:58
People do not like to contradict
10:00
themselves. Which means if you can get
10:02
people to start committing to an action,
10:05
they are going to want to remain
10:07
consistent in the behavior they've
10:09
already taken. And we're going to look
10:10
at examples of all of these in a second.
10:13
Next up is liking. People buy from
10:15
people that they like or that they think
10:17
are like them. Reciprocity. People buy
10:20
from people that have already given them
10:23
value. Scarcity. People buy things that
10:26
they feel are in short supply. And the
10:28
last one, which was actually added after
10:30
the book was already published, is
10:33
unity. And this is where people buy when
10:36
they feel that that purchase makes them
10:39
part of a group. Now, if you want a
10:42
checklist of these things and some
10:44
actionable items on how you can apply
10:46
this inside of a landing page, for
10:49
example, I'll have a link in the
10:51
description with a prompt that you can
10:53
run that helps find opportunities for
10:56
integrating each of these things into
10:58
whatever it is that you are building.
10:59
So, check that out if you're interested.
11:01
But, let's look at an example of an app
11:03
that actually does this or integrates
11:06
some of these principles very well. So
11:08
this is one that I found on Mobin and it
11:11
is called Orbit. So as we start looking
11:13
through this onboarding flow, we can see
11:16
that people move through from screen to
11:18
screen. Then they start actually
11:20
selecting different subscriptions that
11:23
they might have like Netflix and Disney
11:25
Plus and Spotify and all of these
11:27
different things. And at the end of all
11:28
that, it actually totals how much money
11:31
they could be saving each year if they
11:34
killed off some of these subscriptions.
11:37
But then as they continue through, they
11:40
get hit with a hard payw wall. Now, when
11:42
we're on this hard payw wall, there are
11:45
a few of these things that we just
11:46
talked about that are immediately
11:49
triggered. So, we have authority
11:50
building with the Apple logo claiming
11:52
this is an app store favorite. We have
11:55
social proof showing that it's got 4.8
11:58
stars, and we have a review showing down
12:01
here as well. We have a strong
12:03
triggering of commitment and consistency
12:05
because someone just spent time going
12:07
through an onboarding flow. And now if
12:10
they were to just exit the app at this
12:12
point, that would be kind of painful
12:14
psychologically to do, right? You feel
12:17
compelled based on everything you just
12:19
did to actually move through to the next
12:21
step and sign up so that you can see
12:24
just how much money it is that you are
12:26
going to save, for example, on your app
12:28
subscriptions. You could also view this
12:30
15576
12:32
as a form of reciprocity where we've
12:34
already totaled up the savings for them.
12:36
One thing that I would consider
12:38
improving on this page is instead of
12:40
saying orbit customers, how could you
12:42
maybe speak to the actual identity of
12:45
the person and try to ratchet up that
12:47
sense of likeness? Hey, that person's
12:50
just like me and unity that you are now
12:52
a part of something. So, you absolutely
12:55
need to think through each of these
12:57
elements and how you can integrate them
13:00
at each point of your marketing from
13:02
your landing page to the actual UX
13:04
inside of your app to your ads to every
13:07
other piece of marketing that you have.
13:09
Because if you don't, you're going to
13:10
have a weak conversion rate, poor buyer
13:12
trust, and most likely high churn. And
13:15
ain't nobody got time for that. So, next
13:17
up at number three on the list, we have
13:18
a book called Yes. 50 scientifically
13:22
proven ways to be persuasive. So the
13:25
author of the last book, Robert Chelini,
13:27
is one of the co-authors in this book
13:30
because these are a giant grouping of
13:33
very practical implementations
13:37
of those principles. So if you like
13:39
datadriven approaches to things, this is
13:42
going to be a very good one to read. So
13:44
there's a few important concepts that
13:45
they introduce in this book. The first
13:47
is that one of the most important things
13:50
is just how you frame something. So, for
13:53
example, if you wanted people to stop
13:55
littering, telling them, "Hey, don't
13:57
litter. There's a fine." is actually a
14:00
lot less effective at getting them not
14:02
to litter, than to say, "Most people
14:05
don't litter here." So, number one is
14:07
that framing beats force. The second
14:11
piece is that social proof, which we
14:13
talked about earlier, actually works a
14:16
lot better when it is specific. So
14:19
people tend to follow the behavior of
14:21
other people more when they believe
14:23
those people are similar to them. So
14:26
instead of saying join thousands of
14:29
customers, it would be a lot more
14:31
effective to say join a group of
14:34
founders just like you, right? because
14:36
now the identity of the founder is going
14:39
to be a lot more impactful than just
14:41
saying thousands of customers. So
14:43
wherever possible, try to be specific in
14:46
your social proofs. So number three,
14:48
taking that idea of commitment and
14:50
consistency to the next level is that
14:52
you should actually ask for commitment
14:54
before you ask for action. So what this
14:57
means is that a series of smaller yeses
15:01
that are easy for somebody will
15:03
eventually lead at a much higher rate to
15:05
one big yes. So number four is pretty
15:09
similar to number two, which is this
15:12
idea that similarity is a shortcut. So
15:16
anytime you can highlight a shared
15:19
identity or any shared piece of
15:22
information,
15:23
it's going to increase compliance when
15:26
asking someone to take an action. And
15:28
last but not least, highlight the cost
15:30
of inaction. So instead of telling
15:33
someone that your app helps improve
15:35
productivity, it's a lot more powerful
15:38
to say that you'll stop losing 10 hours
15:41
per week. So where these two things
15:43
effectively do the same thing inside of
15:46
like your app for example, they have a
15:48
much different impact on people
15:50
psychologically depending on how you
15:51
framed it. And so these are just five of
15:53
the principles. There's a ton of them in
15:56
the book. Highly recommend you read it.
15:58
Now, one simple example of this is
16:01
Spotify's website for premium where
16:04
they're triggering the reciprocity bias
16:06
by giving you one month for free and
16:09
they're also talking about the identity,
16:11
right? It's for artists and it's for
16:12
fans. But the reality is when it comes
16:15
to your app UX and your landing pages,
16:18
the odds are you probably update stuff
16:20
kind of randomly and that means a lot of
16:23
missed optimizations,
16:25
backfiring strategies, and easy wins
16:28
that just get left on the table. So
16:30
these books so far have been about like
16:32
the strategy of how to actually position
16:36
on a high level. But the next two books
16:38
cover off on this idea of what do I say
16:41
though? So zooming out for a second, we
16:44
are talking to people at the right
16:46
awareness level. We're talking to them
16:48
at the right sophistication level and
16:51
we're using a bunch of these known kind
16:53
of biases to how people make decisions.
16:56
So now we need to start talking about
16:58
like well then how do you actually
16:59
communicate this? So the next book up is
17:01
called Take Their Money by Kyle Milligan
17:05
who is a direct response copywriter. And
17:07
the main thesis behind the book is that
17:10
people buy emotionally and they justify
17:13
those decisions logically. And if you
17:16
accept that to be true, well then it
17:18
just becomes about well, how do you
17:19
trigger that emotional brain in what you
17:23
are writing and how you're positioning
17:25
what you say. And so there's four core
17:29
principles that you should then engineer
17:32
everything you write about around. You
17:34
need to think of things through the lens
17:36
of being new, easy, safe, or big. So,
17:42
let's unpack that and talk about what
17:44
exactly that means. Human brains are
17:46
engineered to look for novelty and to
17:51
protect themselves. And so, these
17:53
concepts of things being new, easy,
17:56
safe, or big hit on all of those points.
18:00
And you tend to see this a lot more over
18:03
the top in cheesier marketing. So let's
18:07
look at a few examples in the B2B space,
18:09
which is probably one where you'd think
18:11
stuff like this is less applicable. So I
18:14
pulled three websites kind of at random
18:16
from the Y Combinator startup directory.
18:19
Let's take a look at them. ODO keeps
18:21
your cafe shelves stocked so you can
18:24
spend more time upfront. So let's start
18:27
scrolling through this page and see what
18:28
we can find. So this concept, we supply
18:31
everything you need and we mean
18:33
everything. That is both easy and it is
18:36
big, right? They're supplying everything
18:38
I need, which means I don't need to
18:40
think about all of this different stuff.
18:42
And to make the claim that you do
18:45
everything is a big claim to make. No
18:48
hidden fees, safety, next day delivery,
18:52
easy. Our smart operations makes it
18:55
easier to run and grow your cafe. Smart
18:59
stocking insights. It feels like magic.
19:03
10 hours saved per week. 20% saved on
19:06
cost of goods. These are all variations
19:09
of something being new, safe, easy, and
19:15
big because there's a lot of different
19:17
phrasing and terminology that you can
19:20
use to communicate those ideas. Another
19:22
good example is this company called
19:24
Pager Duty, which is a B2B incident
19:27
management software for like DevOps. 74%
19:31
less downtime is a big outcome.
19:35
400% gain in ROI, big outcome. 60x SLA
19:41
improvement, very big outcome. 99%
19:44
faster task completion, very big
19:46
outcome. trusted by over 30,000
19:50
companies. It is safe. Can look at
19:53
another example, GitLab. There's 50
19:55
million people already using it, right?
19:57
Safe. Less time managing tools, more
19:59
time delivering features. It's easy. So,
20:02
point being, any successful website that
20:04
you look at has manifestations of these
20:07
things. So, again, if you want to
20:08
actually convert people, make sure
20:10
you're thinking through these concepts.
20:13
How can you communicate
20:15
new, easy, safe, big? So, the last book
20:19
on the list is probably one of the
20:21
easiest reads. It's called the ones
20:23
sentence persuasion course by Blair
20:26
Warren. So, like I said earlier in the
20:28
video, it is the single simplest
20:31
packaging of how to actually market an
20:34
idea to a group of people. And this is
20:36
what it says. People will do anything
20:39
for people that encourage their dreams.
20:42
justify their failures, allay their
20:45
fears, confirm their suspicions, and
20:49
help throw rocks at their enemies. One
20:52
of the keys to really succeeding with
20:55
AIdriven businesses today is to own and
20:59
grow your own audience. If you were to
21:02
break down any influencer that's very
21:06
popular that you follow, I guarantee you
21:09
if you were to think about their
21:10
content, you can plug it all into each
21:14
of those points. You can see where
21:16
they're encouraging your dreams, where
21:19
they're justifying why you failed and
21:21
why it's not your fault. And I can
21:24
guarantee you they're throwing giant
21:27
rocks at somebody that you also don't
21:30
like because it helps create that sense
21:33
of likeness. This person is like me.
21:36
They think like me. They're saying the
21:38
things that I wish I could say, which
21:41
creates that sense of unity and makes
21:43
you want to follow and support that
21:45
person. So that's it, guys. Five books
21:47
that will change how you make money with
21:49
AI products or really any type of
21:52
product. So, if you want to see the
21:53
video where I break down all of those
21:55
pillars and principles from Eugene
21:56
Schwarz in detail, I will link to that
22:00
video right over here. But that is it
22:02
for this video. I will see you in the
22:05
next
