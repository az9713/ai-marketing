# Copy Optimizer

Use this skill to apply evidence-backed tactical improvements to marketing copy. Based on the research from "Yes! 50 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be Persuasive."

## Core Tactics

### 1. Framing Beats Force

**Principle**: How you frame a message matters more than the message itself.

| Weak Framing | Strong Framing |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Don't write bad code" | "Join developers who write clean code" |
| "Avoid slow deployments" | "Ship as fast as the best teams" |
| "Stop wasting time" | "Spend your time on what matters" |

**Application**: Reframe negatives as positives. Show what TO DO, not what to avoid.

### 2. Specific Social Proof

**Principle**: People follow others LIKE THEM more than generic crowds.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Join thousands of users" | "Join 10,000 founders like you" |
| "Loved by developers" | "Loved by senior engineers at Stripe and Shopify" |
| "Many companies trust us" | "Trusted by 500 YC startups" |

**Application**: Add specificity that matches your target audience's identity.

### 3. Loss Aversion

**Principle**: Pain of losing is 2x more powerful than pleasure of gaining.

| Gain Frame | Loss Frame (2x stronger) |
|------------|--------------------------|
| "Increase productivity" | "Stop losing 10 hours per week" |
| "Get more done" | "Stop leaving money on the table" |
| "Improve code quality" | "Stop shipping bugs to production" |

**Application**: Reframe benefits as avoided losses.

### 4. Similarity Shortcut

**Principle**: Shared identity increases compliance dramatically.

| Generic | Identity-Matched |
|---------|------------------|
| "A tool for teams" | "Built for remote-first teams" |
| "For developers" | "For developers who hate context-switching" |
| "Business software" | "For founders who code" |

**Application**: Identify and call out shared characteristics.

### 5. Commitment Ladder

**Principle**: Small yeses lead to big yeses.

| Asking Too Much | Commitment Ladder |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Sign up for annual plan" | 1. "Try free" → 2. "Upgrade monthly" → 3. "Save with annual" |
| "Buy now" | 1. "See demo" → 2. "Start trial" → 3. "Add payment" |

**Application**: Create a series of small commitments before the big ask.

### 6. Contrast Effect

**Principle**: Show the alternative first to make your offer shine.

| Without Contrast | With Contrast |
|------------------|---------------|
| "$99/month" | "Skip the $50k enterprise contract. Just $99/month." |
| "Easy setup" | "No more 6-week implementations. Set up in 5 minutes." |

**Application**: Reference the painful alternative before showing your solution.

### 7. Labeling

**Principle**: People become what you call them.

| No Label | With Label |
|----------|------------|
| "Try our tool" | "You're the type of developer who ships fast. This is your tool." |
| "Join us" | "Join the engineers who refuse to compromise on quality" |

**Application**: Label your audience as the person they want to be.

## Optimization Process

## Quick Reference: Tactic Selection

| If the copy is... | Apply this tactic |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Negative/preachy | Framing (reframe as positive) |

| Not connecting with audience | Similarity Shortcut + Labeling |
| Asking too much upfront | Commitment Ladder |
| Missing context | Contrast Effect |

## Examples

### Before
> "Our AI helps developers write better code faster."

- Gain-framed (not using loss aversion)
- No identity match
- No contrast

### After (All Tactics Applied)
> "Stop losing hours to debugging. Join 10,000 senior engineers who ship 3x faster with context-aware AI. Unlike generic autocomplete, we read your entire codebase."

### Tactics Used
1. **Loss Aversion**: "Stop losing hours to debugging"
2. **Specific Social Proof**: "10,000 senior engineers"
3. **Labeling**: "senior engineers who ship 3x faster"
4. **Contrast**: "Unlike generic autocomplete"
