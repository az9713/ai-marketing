## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leading with features, not benefits**
2. **No quick start in first screenful**
3. **Wall of text before any code**
4. **Missing social proof**
5. **Assuming awareness** (explain the problem!)
6. **Generic "awesome" claims** without specifics
7. **No clear CTA** (install command, star request)
